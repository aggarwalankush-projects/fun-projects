## fun-projects

Some timepass/fun project repository. Contains Projects implemented for fun and some for assignments.

##### KBC
Kaun Banega Crorepati (popularly known as KBC) is an Indian television game show based on the UK game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Tried to simulate the game using java swings and mysql.

##### Wifi Packets Analysis
This project takes input a converted txt file of pcap file. It then analyze these IEEE 802.11 packets and output useful information such as total APs, clients in network, overhead fraction, which client used maximum bandwidth. It also outputs a text file named bitrate.txt showing bitrates(Mbps) of dataframes. We can sniff packets using tools such as Kismet tool.

##### String Matching
It includes string matching using three algorithms. Traditional Edit Distance, Edit Distance with Transposition and Approximate Substring match algorithm. It also compares the performance of first two. 

##### ShfitAND_KMP
This project implements and compares the two popular string searching algorithm ShiftAND and KMP(Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm). The algorithms look for occurences of pattern in input file. 

##### DNSDelay
This program can be used to find dns delay of the packets in milliseconds. 

##### POSTagger
Understand the functionality of OpneNLP PosTagger using PennTreeBank.
